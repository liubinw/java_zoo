USER INSTRUCTIONS:

A zoo will be an object that contains a list of animals. The kinds of animals 
are up to you! There should be a base Animal class, which is reccommended to 
be abstract, and an enumeration for the color of the animal. It is advised to 
make a gender for the animals, but optional due to the potential for extreme 
complexity. One animal species must have different breeds, kinda like doggos 
have lotsa breeds, go for like 2 or 3 which will all call the super constructor 
(in class Dog in this example). Lets go for some diversity and say 5 species of 
animals and 2 to 3 breeds. The animals should be named of course! Make the name 
of an Animal a final field as animals don't change their names. Extra credit if 
u use an Interface somehow but not extra credit if you fail java naming conventions. 
Comment as you see fit, nothing unecessary!

In the zoo, there will be 8 cages which house between 3 and 5 animals. 
The animals get panicky about the state of diversity at the zoo if there 
is only one species in their cage. Panicky animals aren't cute animals 
which doesnt earn you any money. Albeit, cute animals dont earn you any 
money either but they garner more praise than do panicky animals so have at it. 
DONT LET THE ANIMALS EAT EACH OTHER!!! EATEN ANIMALS GARNER THE MOST RIDICULE 
AND OUTRIGHT ANGER SO DONT LET IT HAPPEN!!! (If you want to take this route, 
an enumeration like herbivore, omnivore, carnivore would make for a simple easy solution).
